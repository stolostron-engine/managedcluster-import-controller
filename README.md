# managedcluster-import-controller

This is a temporary tracking repo for `stolostron/managedcluster-import-controller`.

Its purpose is to make the contents of `stolostron/managedcluster-import-controller` available within
the `stolostron-engine` org so that builds can be set up.
Once we are ready to cut over, this tracking repo will be deleted and the
`stolostron/managedcluster-import-controller` repo will be transferred into the `stolostron-engine` org.

No changes should be committed directly to this repo.  Rather than should
be committed into tracked branches of the `stolostron/managedcluster-import-controller` repo.
